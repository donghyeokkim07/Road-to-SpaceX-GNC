Korean high school senior (18) → POSTECH Class of 2030

On Nov 27, 2025 I emailed:
- Keith Nicewarner (Principal GNC Engineer)
- Lars Blackmore (Director, Starship GNC & Mars Landing)
- Jacob Katz (GNC Engineer)
- Elon Musk

I'm waiting for advice… but already starting with winter self-study to build stronger foundations.

### Current level (honest)
- High-school physics & basic Python
- Completed high-school calculus (single variable, as elective), but no multivariable calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, or reinforcement learning… yet

### Winter Break Plan (Dec 2025 - Feb 2026)
This is my self-study curriculum to build foundations for aerospace GNC and AI. One main subject per week, with TOEFL and aviation maintenance certification in parallel. Additionally, I will be attending a coding academy to learn advanced Python and C language.

1. **Python Programming (Week 1–2)**  
   Books: Python for Data Analysis – Wes McKinney; Think Python – Allen Downey (free eBook)  
   Lectures: MIT 6.0001/6.0002 (Python-based CS); Google "Python for Everybody" (free); UniStudy Python Intro (Korean)  
   Goals: Basic syntax; Numpy, Matplotlib; Scipy ODE solver for 1st/2nd ODE; Jupyter Notebook mastery

2. **Calculus I (Week 3)**  
   Books: Stewart Calculus; MIT 18.01 notes (free PDF)  
   Lectures: MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus; K-MOOC University Calculus  
   Goals: Differentiation/Integration; Taylor series; Definite/indefinite integral techniques; Connect to high-school physics

3. **Calculus II - Multivariable (Week 4)**  
   Books: Vector Calculus – Marsden & Tromba; Stewart Multivariable Calculus  
   Lectures: MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus  
   Goals: Multiple integrals (double/triple); New coordinates (spherical/cylindrical); ∇, div, curl; Foundations for fluid mechanics/electromagnetism

4. **Differential Equations ODE (Week 5)**  
   Books: Elementary Differential Equations – Boyce & DiPrima; MIT 18.03 notes (free PDF)  
   Lectures: MIT 18.03 Differential Equations  
   Goals: 1st/2nd ODE; Vibration/damping/forced oscillation; Prep for control theory/dynamics

5. **Linear Algebra (Week 6)**  
   Books: Linear Algebra and Its Applications – Gilbert Strang; Introduction to Linear Algebra – Strang  
   Lectures: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra (Strang); K-MOOC Linear Algebra  
   Goals: Matrices/operations; Basis/dimension; Eigenvalues/eigenvectors; Rotation matrices; Foundations for ML/control/GNC

6. **General Physics I (Week 7)**  
   Books: Fundamentals of Physics – Halliday & Resnick; University Physics – Young & Freedman  
   Lectures: MIT 8.01 Classical Mechanics; UniStudy General Physics I  
   Goals: Newtonian mechanics; Work/energy; Impulse/momentum; Rotational mechanics → Direct link to dynamics

7. **Dynamics MECH211 Intro (Week 8)**  
   Books: Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics – Meriam & Kraige; Hibbeler Dynamics  
   Lectures: YouTube "Dynamics Engineering Lectures"; MIT 8.01 advanced (rotation/vibration)  
   Goals: Particle/rigid body motion; Rotational motion; Momentum/angular momentum; Learn dynamics analysis → Apply to SURF research (drone/satellite attitude control)

**Parallel Studies (8–10 weeks)**  
- TOEFL: Official TOEFL iBT Tests (ETS); Hackers TOEFL; Magoosh TOEFL Prep. Daily 1 hour, target R26/L27/S22/W25 (total 100–105) for POSTECH certification.  
- Aviation Maintenance Certification Written: "Aviation Maintenance Certification One Book" (Eduwill or SidaeGosi); 15-year past questions. 3–4 times/week, 40–60 min/session. Focus on memorization (airframe/engine/electric/instruments/aerodynamics) → Prep for military mechanical specialty.

### Long-term Plan
- **Undergrad (POSTECH)**: Double major in Mechanical Engineering + Computer Science. Join Fluid Physics & Engineering Lab and Pohang Aerospace Research Society. GPA A+ focus. Summer 2nd year: Caltech SURF (JPL or Soon-Jo Chung Lab). 3rd year: NASA I² internship. Military service as Air Force Aerospace Mechanical Specialist.
- **Grad School**: Caltech Aerospace (control/GNC priority), MIT LGO/AeroAstro, or Stanford Aero & Robotics.
- **Career**: Engineer at SpaceX/NASA JPL.
- **Key Focus**: Autonomous rocket landing control, AI in GNC, AI + Vision navigation, spacecraft dynamics, reusable launch vehicle design, Mars landing/EDL.

First code commit coming soon – starting with a simple rocket sim.
